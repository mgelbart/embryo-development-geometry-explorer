Unzip the EDGE folder. Open MATLAB and go to the EDGE directory. Type `install` into MATLAB. Restart MATLAB after the script completes. Email Michael Gelbart at michael (dot) gelbart (at) gmail (dot( com if you get any errors.

#### Optional installation step ####
If you work with large data sets, you will also want to tell MATLAB to give Java more memory. To do this, open the MATLAB Preferences --> General --> Java Heap Memory and set the memory size to something larger. You must restart MATLAB for this change to take effect.
